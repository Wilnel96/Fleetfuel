## Notes

- If you need to reset or change passwords, you'll need to use Supabase's password reset functionality
- Driver access uses a separate authentication system (first name + date of birth)
- All data is properly isolated - clients cannot see each other's data
- Super admin has visibility across all clients for management and reporting
